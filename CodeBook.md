Signals
The 3-axial time domain [5] signals from accelerometer and gyroscope were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz [6]. Then they were filtered to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another filter. Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals [7]. Also the magnitude [8] of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm [9]. Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [10] was applied to some of these time domain signals to obtain frequency domain [11] signals.
The signals were sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window at 50 Hz). From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
The set of variables that were generated from these signals were:
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.
iqr(): Interquartile range
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autoregression coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): Correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): Index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): Skewness of the frequency domain signal
kurtosis(): Kurtosis of the frequency domain signal
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between some vectors.
No unit of measures is reported as all features were normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

# Creation of a tidy data set #
From the intermediate data set is created a final tidy data set where numeric variables are averaged for each activity and each subject.
The tidy data set contains 10299 observations with 81 variables divided in:
an activity label (Activity): WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment (Subject): 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30
a 79-feature vector with time and frequency domain signal variables (numeric)
